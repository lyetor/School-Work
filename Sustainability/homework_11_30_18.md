### Introduction of you to me

Why are you taking this course? Be honest.

What is it that rings your bell? What would you like to learn more about?

Conversely, what makes you nervous or gives you pause about the course or the subject matter?

If you took this course in a previous trimester, what part of the subject matter do you expect to bring forward? What are your expectations? Hesitations? Be honest.

Finally, is there something going on in your world that may impact your performance this trimester that you feel I should know about? Discretion is absolutely respected.



I took this course for two main reasons, with one being much more prominent than the other. The first being that I desperately need arts credits based on my want to double up on math and science junior and senior year. I also enjoy science a lot and felt that if I'm getting an art credit I may as well take a class I will enjoy and learn a lot about.

I love to learn about math and science. Sure sitting in a math class if fun but seeing an elegant proof to a very complicated problem or really seeing beautiful solutions in math is so fun. While science class is also enjoyable researching topics on your own and having that "light bulb" go off in your head is very fun, especially after going down a rabbithole. I do debate and have started enjoying the actual research of the given topic a lot more, appreciating when I find specific things I spent a while looking for. I'm interested in learning what this course will really be about.

I'm nervous because the people who I've talked to that have taken Sustainability have warned me about the workload. I'm also somewhat worried because I'm unsure how harsh your grading is and what skills I need to learn in order to properly tackle this course and pursue academic excellence.
