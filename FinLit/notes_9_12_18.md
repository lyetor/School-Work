**Liabilities, Equity, Leadership, Manager/Leader, and Group v Team**
* Equity = Assets - Liabilities

	* No other way to calculate equity
* Three things on a balance sheet:
	1. Equity
	2. Assets
	3. Liabilities
* Leadership:
	* A *bad* leader forces others to do work like a "boss"
	* A *good* leader works within the team along with giving orders a "leader"
	* Influencing others to understand and agree
	* Process of facilitating individual and collective efforts to do shared objectives
* Managers and Leaders:
	* A manager is a day to day proles solver
	* Managers control operations and make sure they're done efficiently
