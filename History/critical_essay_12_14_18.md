1. How does your Philosopher define the social contract? What shape would they use? Which terms included? Excluded? What holds it together? Explain, and support with evidence.
   * People should support the ideas of the colonized and oppressed 
   * There can't be a social contract in a colonized society 
   * 

2. Washington recently legalized the use of marijuana.  Other states are considering similar bills.  Is this a good thing?  Why or why not?  Should legalization of drugs depend on whether they are “soft” drugs as compared to “hard” drugs like heroin?

3. Following the lead of Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers football quarterback, many NFL players across the league have taken a knee rather than standing during the national anthem before football games several times during the past three football seasons as a protest against violence by police against people of color in the US.  To what extent has his protest been helpful as a means of focusing attention on the ongoing problems of racism and police brutality in the US?  Does it make any difference or matter that Kaepernick also now appears in an advertisement for Nike?  What effect does the commercialization of social and political activism have on the issues and whether or not any real change or reform is created?

4. The death of dissident Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the questions about the involvement of the Saudi government (especially the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman) have created a difficult situation for the United States.  For several decades the US enjoyed a close relationship with the Saudi government that has included easy access to oil for the US and huge arms sales for the Saudis.  The US has relied on Saudi Arabia as a partner in the Middle East to maintain peace and stability in the region, including the security of Israel, and as a counterbalance against Iran.  If the Saudi government is responsible for Khashoggi’s death, should the US change its relationship?  If so, how and how much?  Which is most important for the US in this situation—trade, international diplomacy, or protecting the principle of free speech with a free press?
   * Saudi government is oppressing the people, something that has to change
