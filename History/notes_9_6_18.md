* 1400s

**Questions:**

   or conquer a neighboring civilization. What do you do?
	* Raising taxes will directly hurt your citizen and economy
	* If we invade people will die, we might lose, and we we'll lose a lot
	  of resources
	* Plan is to tax, but give breaks to farmers, which incentives becoming 
	  a farmer giving us more resources
	* When farming is cheaper it makes food cheaper and it creates more farmers
	  perpetuating the cycle
	* Luxuries get have a sales tax
	* Farmers have to apply for a farming license and produce verification

**Video: Why did Civilizations Expand**
* Diverse societies
* We have to identify patterns in seemingly unrelated tings
* They really needed to expand
	* We See that with the Romans, Mongols, and Persians
* These civilizations collapsed when they got smaller
* Larger populations need infrastructure, government, and military (also luxuries)
* Armies specifically needed a lot of money, creating a cycle 
	* Subjects hated heavy taxation
* Due to subjects hating taxation they didn't have internal resources, thus they 
  would grow to take what others produced
* Limits to how much growth could come internally 
* Their growth came from what others ha produced (from conquering)
	* Even the Chinese, Aztecs, and Incas
* Armies need Food Weapons Roads Forts and Walls
* Military inventions advanced entire civilizations, specifically iron
* Is population growth a bad thing? 
* Borders were constantly contested
* Borders became places for innovation
* Change from larger empires to smaller states
* Empires were less physical borders but commercial influence
* Military made trade better by protecting trade routes
* Collective learning intensified at these "borders"
* Traditional agrarian societies lost power to these competitive smaller European states
* Commercial enterprise took over these agrarian societies
* The most successful empires we hear about have the most land
* All of these big empires had larger expensive armies making it a self repeating cycle
* Roads went from military routes to trade routes
* These contested borders were essential to technical innovation which had non-military interactions
