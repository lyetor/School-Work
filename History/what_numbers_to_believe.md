**What numbers to believe, in class work**

Imagine you're a textbook writer, what *number* would you cite as the amount as
the amount of population decline? 

I don't agree with these sources because they seem suspect for different 
reasons. An estimate floating around between people is between 50 and 90 percent
, and looking at these sources leads me to believe the actual number is 
somewhere in this range. Recency plays a large role in the credibility of the 
source and their biases. Some of the documents are extrapolated from data taken
by biased sources, making them farther away from the actual number. I feel it 
best for people to quote the largely affirmed estimate that ranges from 50-90%
rather than trying to hone in on a number that may or may not be true.
