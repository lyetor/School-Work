**Why early Globalization?**
* Collective learning: accumulation of information
	* Gave birth to agriculture
* Globalization brought the separate 4 zones brought them together
	1. Printing 
	2. Potato's
	3. Plagues
* Expanded/migrated very slowly throughout the world
	* These zones never really communicated with each other
* The learning of the Americas only came from themselves
* Fire-stick farming is foraging through the usage of large forest fires
* Early agriculture starts with a decline, and then got better
* Population growth led to the need for agriculture
* In Afro-Eurasia there was travel and collective learning throughout such a large place
* All of them came to similar solutions to the same problems, without any communication with each other
* P, P, P:
1. Writing allowed for much better communication, and helped collective learning. There were still issues but it was good
	* The Chinese had many ways to do it
	* Books were a luxury good for a while
	* Korean's had a better version of writing
	* Europe had the printing press, which revolutionized reading/book printing
	* In 50 years more books were printed than copied in the past 600 years
2. Potato was first domesticated in Meso-America, they can grow in any climate and enrich the soil
	* Helped all of South America
	* It's much easier than corn and wheat
	* Many sailors packed potato's on longer journeys
	* Potato was introduced into East Asia around 1600s
	* This delayed/stopped many famines in Asia
	* Irish potato famine was due to the reliance on one fragile potato
	* Famine was an issue from globalization
3. Plagues happened because of globalization
	* Moved along the silk road 
	* Brings up an issue of having population
	* And then the diseases went to Americas
	* Americans had no natural immunity to these
	* 50 million Americans were killed within a 100 years
	* This lost collective learning in Americas
* Globalization had both positive and negative impacts
* We're still in a period of rapid globalization along with its positive and negative impacts 

**Questions:**
* Collective learning definition 
* Globalization (early connection)
* Timeline of printing: Chinese, Korean, and Gutenberg 
* When/where of trading of silk road 
	* Today in China? -> political response?
* How the plagues were spread, and the different types of disease
* Advantage and disadvantage of globalization
