### Scientific Revolution

* Prior to the Scientific revolution medieval scientists cited the Bible or ancient Greek and Roman authors
  *  Pre-revolution Aristotle and Ptolemy believed the universe revolved around the Earth and that stars+moons were made out of pure substances 
* Copernicus proposed the idea that the current paradigm broke down with the evidence he created
* Galileo backed up Copernicus and Kepler's ideas with empirical evidence
  * He was also one who challenged the Church, and people's viewing of the Church 
* The Scientific revolution brought about a change in paradigm that science is backed up with empirical evidence (repeatable experiments) rather than from the Church
* Faulty medieval evidence:
  * Metal is a species 
  * Animals were designed by God to be a tool used by men
  * The Bible's lack of saying angels move planets
* New scientific method:
  1. A problem or question that arises from an observation
  2. A hypothesis is made
  3. Hypothesis is tested through experiment
  4. Data is analyzed and a conclusion is drawn from it 
* The Church was scared that people would no longer believe them under this new paradigm 

- Paradigm:
  - Things we can find solutions to
  - Overturning happens when we can't explain with the paradigm, AKA: Anomalies 
- Many scientists overturned the past paradigm such as Newton or Einstein
- There were battles within universities and books, but most were illiterate
- By the seventeenth century we had moved past Greek science 
- Too many anomalies led to the scientific revolution 
  - The past paradigm was breaking down to much in the face of new discoveries and pieces of evidence 
- Mathematical graphs were pioneered at this time
- Nicole Oreseme had the same ideas prior to others, but no one backed him up on these

* Copernicus published *De revolutionibus orbium coelestium libri VI* on his death bed in 1534
* Copernicus postulated a heliocentric solar system instead of the geocentric idea that the Church theorized 
  * He used ideas from others, and these ideas had already been stated
  * Copernicus ideates that the sun centered model is a better paradigm 
* Tycho Brahe measured stellar and planetary movements more precisely than anyone else
  * Brahe thought the Earth was motionless
  * Copernicus convinced him that the sun was the center of the cosmos
  * Tycho also doubted Aristotle's conjecture on the perfection of celestial objects   
* These scientist's discoveries kept building on each other, making learning as a rise 
  * Brahe's observations allowed Kepler to discover that Mars orbited in an ellipse rather than in a circle
* Kepler came up with the idea of magenetism, which was considered "magic" at the time
* Newton created his three laws of motion, postulated gravity, came up with calculus, and did much more for the scientific revolution 
* The *Principia* published by Newton marked the culmination of the movement started by Copernicus
