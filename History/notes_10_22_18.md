### Gold

*We bought gold!*(NPR):

* Food court with stalls but with jewelry and gold 

* Why did gold price double?

* **What gives something value?**

* Gold doesn't have any value

* **Is gold worth anything? Money is worthless**

* "Gold market is a psychology" - Dennis Gartman  

  * People are afraid of inflation 
  * If everyone believes it has value, it does

* Gold is nothing more than an idea 

* Some think we're in a gold bubble

* It's so volatile 


*Why gold beat other Elements*(NPR):

* Elements that won't work as currency 

  * Need applying characteristics and won't change

* Many elements are too reactive or don't have solid states

* Radioactive elements won't work because of decay and health

* It has to be rare, but not too rare

* Now we have five left:

   	1. Silver(Has been used)
   	2. Gold
   	3. Platinum(Way too high of a melting point)
   	4. Rhodium(Early civilizations didn't have access)
   	5. Palladium (Early civilizations didn't have access)

* If we went back we'd still pick gold

  * We no longer use gold, but use paper
