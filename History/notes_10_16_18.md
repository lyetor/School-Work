### The History of Money

* *How did humans evolve from hunter gatherers to money?*
* **9000 BCE:** Bartering, no concept of money
  * Trade something you have in surplus for something that you don't have
* Livestock and grain became the first type of money/currency
* **985 BCE:** Shells and metals were starting to be used
  * Blocks of salt were also used for money in Africa
* People on an island used gigantic limestone disks as their currency
* Gold, silver, and bronze coins were used at this point
  * In India, China, and other parts of Asia
* Kaori shells were being used 
* *How'd we go from coins and shells to paper*
* **815 AD:** In ancient China the first paper money started to be sued
  * Empirical evidence was produced by Robin Yates 
* **1415 AD** Europeans were exploring for riches and places to colonize 
  * This is when credit was developed
* Monarchs were giving money for exploration because they knew they'd make the money back
* Credit facilitated a lot of exploration done by the Europeans
* Companies like the Dutch East India company were created 
* Credit helped with the Atlantic slave trade
* Slavery started at this point
* **1816 AD** The English created the gold standard system
* Paper money is thus backed by gold, because gold was tied to paper
  * Every note printed represents a certain amount of gold
* The US thought the idea of money tied to gold would drag down the economy 
* The US tried to recreate this, but created the concept of FIAT money:
  * Where money has no actual tie, but money matters because we say it does
* **Current Day** We no longer need paper money
  * We have electronics and crypto-currencies  
  * Paper really has no relevance any more 
* *Will paper money ever go out of date, like shells did?*
