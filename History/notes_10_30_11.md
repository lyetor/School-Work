### Scientific Revolution

* Revolution happens when scientists can explain things with current paradigms 
* Paradigm:
  * Things we can find solutions to
  * Overturning happens when we can't explain with the paradigm, AKA: Anomalies 
* Many scientists overturned the past paradigm such as Newton or Einstein
* Copernicus proposed heliocentrism 
  * He used ideas from others, and these ideas had already been stated
  * Copernicus ideates that the sun centered model is a better paradigm 
* There were battles within universities and books, but most were literate
* By the seventeenth century we had moved past Greek science 
* Too many anomalies led to the scientific revolution 
* Mathematical graphs were pioneered at this time
* Nicole Oreseme had the same ideas prior to others, but no one backed him up on these
