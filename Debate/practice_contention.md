The United States should no longer pressure Israel to work towards a two-state solution.

Contention 1:
Ceasing pressure on Israel to work toward a two-state solution would decrease the current violence.
As according to The Independent In the Gaza war 20,000 homes were destroyed, killing just over 2,200 
people. Furthermore, 60% of the deaths in the Gaza War were civilians. In February 2018 Aljazeera
stated, "...more than 1,000 Palestinians have died as a result of the ongoing Israeli blockade..."
Throughout the whole conflict 115,000 people have been wounded and over 116,000 people have lost
their lives. After the UN's declaration to work towards a two state solution violence spiked
according the Ireland Journal. A.B. Yehoshua a man who worked for the two-state solution for 50 
years of his life stated, "...the term 'Palestinian State'...is no longer viable in practice"
he continued saying, "...the conflict grew fiercer because of the democratic relations between
the two peoples...", we can see the pushing of the two state solution has only increased violence
and people who've worked towards it, "For 50 years...tirelessly" have realized it will never work.
Relieving the pressure for the two-state solution on the United States' part would decrease the 
violence happening in the status quo, violence that spikes when this two-state solution is mentioned.
