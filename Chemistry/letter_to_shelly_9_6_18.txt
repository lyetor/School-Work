What do you love?
In terms of classes, my favorites have always been Science, Math, and 
Chinese. I spend a lot of my free time programming or doing other types of 
engineering. When I'm not using my free time to write code I'm usually cycling.

What do you most value?
A lot of my values come from my parents, because they have ingrained them on me
from a very young age. I most value work ethic, emotional strength, and 
honesty. I work very hard to stand by these values, but make sure to not try 
and impress them on others.

What are your strengths?
The strengths I feel in the classroom  are determination/work ethic, learning 
content quickly, and helping others. The first one helps me with completing 
my work in a timely manner, the second one aids me with teaching myself, and
the last one is very useful in terms of being a team player.

What are your challenges?
I feel I have two main challenges in the classroom which are: focusing too much 
on my grade and getting off track. As stated earlier a lot of my thought process
comes from my parents, thus I sometimes get tunnel vision on my grade and lose
sight of the goal of the task at hand. Whether it be getting bored of the 
content by going ahead or being disinterested I sometimes get off topic.

Tell me more about yourself:
I love all things STEM, and I am very excited to take this class. If you have 
any constructive criticism for me as a student or person I'm open to hearing it
and improving.
