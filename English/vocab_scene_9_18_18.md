8 Vocab Scene

The dining hall was raucous and the din made everyone's ears hurt. The 
servers were ubiquitous making sure all plates and cups were full. The 
marriage between two kingdoms had just taken place, with the intent of 
engendering new political and economical relations. The magnanimous

newlyweds well. The father of the bride was rather inept with words giving
a banal speech, repeating much of what was already said, making it he 
nadir of the celebration.
