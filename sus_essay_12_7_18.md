### Consumer or Citizen

"...ask not what your country can do for youâ€”ask what you can do for your country". Franklin Roosevelt asked this to the people of the United States over fifty years ago and it still applies today. This quote displays a dichotomy within American people, whether they are consumers who take advantage of what their country does for them or citizens who work for the betterment of those around them. I feel I fall pretty squarely in the middle of this spectrum, but lean towards the side of being a consumer. For the purpose of this essay I think citizenship can be defined as wanting the betterment of a given community one is a part of, and being a consumer can be defined as spending without regard for the implications. I believe the actions I take every day lead me to be more of a consumer than a citizen, due to my actions displaying a want for self advancement over the growth of the different communities that I'm a part of. 

I lean towards the side of the consumer more than the citizen due to the way I buy materials and goods. Every time I go out shopping or browse Amazon, rather than thinking about the larger impact or implications of my purchase, I am thinking about whether I have enough money to purchase the given item. I am much more miserly than my brother, but trashing the environment isn't what is on my mind when I decide not to buy something, it's whether I'm willing to spend the money.  The reason I don't feel I am completely a consumer can be attributed to my family, and specifically my brother. A few years ago, before my brother had access to the Amazon account, every time we got a cardboard box on our doorstep it was something special. My brother, dad, and I would all argue as to who got to open the box. This changed when my brother started buying this on Amazon, and the process of coming home every day to at least one or two boxes became regular, thus taking out the novelty of getting an Amazon box. My brother's spending habits on Amazon, where replacement is paramount if something is slightly sub-par or outdated, depict planned and perceived obsolescence all to well, something Annie Leonard talked about in her video.. He's constantly buying a new product, and has shown me the extent one can take consumerism too, something I feel I'm very far away from. I feel that I'm partly a consumer, but am nowhere near the end of the spectrum.   

I sit in this almost middle ground of the spectrum because of the actions I take everyday. Part of being a consumer is the lack of citizenship, something I can display at times. When I make a purchase, I don't think about how it will affect both those in the United States and around the world, something that takes away from my being a citizen. When reflecting on this video, I realize I have a lot of room to improve when it being a good citizen or even just a citizen. Sure I listen to the news everyday and know what's going on in our country, but very rarely do I take action to help those around me, in any of my communities. Sometimes I will go to a homeless shelter and help out with serving food, but that is usually because my mother is also doing it. I have a lot of room to grow when it comes to being a citizen, thus pushing me towards the side of being a consumer. In her video, Annie Leonard discusses the idea of perceived obsolescence, something I fall victim to a lot. I fell as if the product I have, which is usually working perfectly well, is inferior to a product that is new to the market, making me want to buy the newer version. Even though I don't buy things every day or even week, the way I view the goods I have promotes the ideals of consumerism in my head. The day to day lack of being a good citizen coupled with my mindset that what I have isn't good enough leads me to be a consumer.

I'm a part of this culture of consumerism and I didn't really have any reasons to change that. I grew up and am still growing up in a household where buying something we need or want has always been possible, and that has led me to care most about the golden arrow that Annie Leonard displays in her video. Although I buy less than my family, I still have a mindset of a consumer rather than one of a citizen. My growing up in Seattle has led me to be raised in a very white, affluent bubble. I feel I'm escape this more than my classmates, but I don't act on the knowledge that gives me. For a large portion of my life I didn't hear a good enough reason as to why I should change my mindset, something that was very ignorant. Thus, I am on this part of the spectrum because I embraced the culture of consumerism and didn't have a reason to change. 

Up until around eighth grade I never saw an issue with my mindset or my actions, but then I learned about climate change. The rampancy of climate change in the status quo showed me the urgency and the need to change mindsets from one of consumerism, valuing money more than anything else, to one that values saving the planet and all the people that live in it. This was a tipping point, and led me to realize other grievances in this world that have to be fixed and can be through my actions. I haven't progressed and changed as much as I have wanted to in the past couple of years, but it's something I'm working towards. Although I am currently leaning towards the side of the consumer, I hope that through education and my actions I can change that and make myself a citizen.
